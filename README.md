# pacmen

This exercise was to get pacmen on the screen using a button "add pacmen" and get them to move onclick from the button "start". 
At this point in order to run you just need the forward facing pacman picture and the index .html file 
In the future I would like to get the pacmen to change direction upon hitting a boundary and upon hitting eachother.
